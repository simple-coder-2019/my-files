    <p>Saint Teresa of Calcutta (known as Mother Teresa) was an Albanian-born Indian Roman Catholic missionary and nun who devoted her life to helping those most in need. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in India in 1950, and for over 45 years, she ministered to the poor, sick, orphaned and dying.</p>
    <p>It is reported that there are approximately 700 old age homes in India, of which nearly 46% (325) of old age homes are free of cost, whereas the remaining are on a pay-and-stay basis. There are 728 old-age homes in India today. Detailed information on 547 homes is available.</p>

    <p>An old age home, also called a retirement home, is a residential facility with nursing and assisted living facilities designed for older adults. They receive the necessary assistance and care, from meals, housekeeping, medical care, and recreational activities to maintain their quality of life.</p>
    <P>There are two types of Old Age Homes in India. One is the "Free" type which cares for the destitute old people who have no one else to care for them. They are given shelter, food, clothing and medical care. The second type is the "Paid" home where care is provided for a fee.</P>
    <P>Kerala has 124 old age homes which is maximum in any state. Also, research conducted by Tata Trusts estimated that the total capacity across senior living facilities is currently at 97,000 beds (rounded).</P>

    <p>The reason behind more old age homes in India is that the children don't want to take care of the parents when they grow old they feel it is not important and also they become busy in their lives which is wrong. Our parents have done so much for us when we were young and today when they need our help we don't help out.<br>
    Give them happiness , make them happy. This should be the ultimate gift that any son or daughter would give their parents. When elderly people are happy with their children and grand children…. oldage homes will automatically reduce their numbers.</p></td>
