        <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3><hr>
        <p>Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy (born 21 December 1972), also known as Y. S. Jagan or mononymously as Jagan, is an Indian  politician currently serving as the 17th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is the founder and president of the Indian political party, YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). He is also the son of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. His Mother Y. S. Vijayamma, is the chairperson of YSRCP.[citation needed]

            Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career in the Indian National Congress and was elected as the Member of Parliament of Kadapa in 2009.[17] After his father's death due to a helicopter crash in 2009, he started an Odarpu Yatra (a consoling tour) across the state.[18] He then eventually came out of the Congress Party and established his own party, YSR Congress Party which also matches his father's acronym, YSR.[19]
            
            In 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, YSRCP won 67 seats and he became the Leader of the Opposition.[20] Five years later, in 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, he led the party to a landslide victory in the state elections by winning 151 seats of the total 175 assembly segment.</p><hr>

            <h3>BUSINESS VENTURES</h3><hr>
            <p>Reddy first acquired Sandur Power Company Limited (SPCL), a defunct power project from its original promoter M B Ghorpade in 2001.[27] SPCL later invested crores of rupees in other companies and could acquire more businesses. It is headed by his wife, Y. S. Bharathi.[28] Reddy sold his shares in SPCL and moved away from his active direct businesses as he got more involved in politics.</p>

        <h3>POLITICAL CAREER</h3><hr>
        <p>Reddy's father Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, popularly known as YSR, was a two-time chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, serving from 2004 to 2009. He started his political career campaigning for Indian National Congress during the 2004 elections in Kadapa district.[29] In 2009, he was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency.[29]

            Following the death of his father in September 2009, he started efforts to take up the political legacy left by his father. The majority of the legislators favoured him to be appointed as the Chief Minister, but this choice was not approved by party leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.
            
            Six months after his father's death, he began an odarpu yatra (condolence tour), as promised earlier, to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his odarpu yatra, an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the yatra, stating that it was a personal matter. </p>

            <h3>OVERCOMIG CHALLENGES</h3><hr>
            <p>n what came to be known as the 'quid-pro-quo' cases, Jagan was accused of getting investments into his businesses by firms and individuals in return for the undue favours shown to them by his father in the form of approvals, leases, contracts and government lands.

                Jagan, who termed the cases against him witch-hunting by the Congress and the TDP, was arrested by the CBI on May 27, 2012. He spent 16 months in jail before he was granted bail.
                
                After his release, the young leader found himself in a different political environment with the UPA government's decision to grant statehood to Telangana.</p>
